<h1>Tetris</h1>
My go at the game Tetris, personally one of my favorite games.

<h4>The game's features:</h4>
Spawning all the classic Tetris blocks, moving and rotating them, clearing lines, getting score and leveling up.

<h4>Special Features:</h4>
<strong>Wallkick</strong> mechanics, meaning that if you rotate a block into right or left wall
it will kick the shape back if it's within the boundaries and not colliding with other shapes.<br>
<strong>Infinity</strong> mechanics is added where the shapes has a Locktimer so you can move around the shape for a short period of time after it has collided, to make 
special moves like "T-Spin".<br>

The challenges I've dealt with when creating the game:<br>
Planning out all the Shape's positions storing values using arrays, clearing the board for combos,
the rotation, having a good boundarie control to not let blocks move outside the grid when rotating or moving by prechecking/scanning grid and boundaries.


Controls: ```Left, Right, Down to move, Z, X to rotate, Shift to hold and exchange shapes and Space to drop and lock```
